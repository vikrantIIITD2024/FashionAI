## Conversational Fashion Outfit Generator

This project presents a GenAI-powered conversational fashion outfit generator designed to enhance product discovery through natural dialogue. Instead of traditional keyword-based searches, users interact via chat to receive personalized outfit recommendations based on factors like age group, gender, occasion, region, body type, and color preferences.

Built using Python, the system leverages NLP (NLTK) for text understanding and CNN/ANN/RNN models for image analysis, recommendation logic, and conversational context. Data was scraped from Myntra using XPath Helper, and over 3000+ images were manually annotated with rich metadata across categories like Ethnic, Casual, Gymwear, and Footwear.

A GAN model was also explored for image generation, though limited by dataset size. The system currently runs on Google Colab, with ongoing efforts toward creating a user-friendly web interface and expanding functionality with voice input, social media trends, and automated dataset creation.
